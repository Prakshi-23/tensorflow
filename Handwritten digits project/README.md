# Handwritten Digit Recognition with TensorFlow

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **handwritten digit recognition system** using **TensorFlow and Keras**. The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0-9). The goal is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**
- **MNIST Dataset**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📂 Project Structure
```
|-- tensorflow_handwrittendigits_project.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook with model implementation
|-- README.md  # Project documentation
```

## 📊 Model Architecture
- **Input Layer**: 28x28 grayscale image input
- **Hidden Layers**: Fully connected dense layers with activation functions
- **Output Layer**: 10 neurons (one for each digit from 0-9) with softmax activation
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam

## 🔍 Dataset Information
- **Training Set**: 60,000 images
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images
- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels
- **Labels**: Digits (0-9)

## 🚀 How to Run the Model
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step by step.
4. The model will be trained and tested on the MNIST dataset.

## 📈 Expected Results
- High accuracy in classifying handwritten digits.
- Visualization of training loss and accuracy.
- Model predictions on test images.

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- Implement **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web application.
- Experiment with **different architectures and hyperparameters**.
